- **Scalable**: Efficiently handles large datasets with minimal performance overhead.
- **Extensible**: Easy to integrate with other applications using Flask.
- **Visualization**: Provides visual confirmation of detected duplicates.

## Requirements
- Python (😅)
- virtualenv

To install **venv**: 

```
pip install virtualenv

## Usage

- **Image Folder Preparation**: Make a folder and place all the image files in top level. make sure no other subfolder is present.
- **Copy Folder Path**: ok now copy this folder as path.
- **Paste Folder Path**: paste folder in the input and press submit.
- After successfull run you will see a page to select image for deletion.
- By default all the duplicate imges are selected for deletion but check the selected images for any incorrect selection.
- Press deleted selected to delete all the duplicate files.
- Finally, open the image directory. Images are now duplicate free.
- A backup folder is created with all the original files (with duplicates) in case anything goes wrong.
